<!-- 
I'll use them to explain the template. 
You can use them to suggest things to devs, or just as notes. 
You can remove all of these when writing your own if you like, just copy this template, and give it a new name.

<!-- How this template works -->

<!-- 
A dialogue is a collections of characters, locations and a script
Think of it as a cutscene which interrupts gameplay, and does not go back to gameplay until it finishes.
-->

<!-- 
First you declare which characters will be used in this dialogue, then what locations will be used. 
Characters are defined in characters.xml, a separate file. You can set their color, sprite, and animations there.
Same deal for locations in locations.xml 
-->

<!--
A script is a collection of shots which will be included in this script.

A shot is a collection of lines, followed by a set of responses.

lines will be played sequentially, and the player will the be presented with options.

options are a list of responses, or a dialogue_end tag. They may contain text, but they must always either contain either:
	an id for the next shot (whichs allows for decision trees) 
	or a dialogue_end tag (which exits the dialogue)
-->
