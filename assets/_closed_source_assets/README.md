# Closed Source Assets

## Any files contained in this folder will not be saved to the main repo.

The project from this repo will be structured to make use of files from this folder, but will not store files. 
This should be used for asset which we do not want to be made publically available within the open-source project, but still want to compile with the final packaged game. 

A separate repo as been made, for these files. Clone that repo into this folder when making use of closed source assets. 

Ensure a stub exists in the main project as placeholder for every asset which will be used.
